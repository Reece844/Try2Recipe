Note: You can use dried herbs if you don't have fresh. For the bread, I used about 3/4 of a loaf of large miche for Thanksgiving.


Heat 2-3 Tbsp olive oil in large fry pan. Sauté the onion until translucent (about 5 minutes). Add the carrot and celery, season with salt and pepper and continue to sauté
about 5-7 minutes. Add the herbs and sauté for about 2 minutes. Add a couple of tablespoons of butter, add bread cubes after butter is melted and drizzle a little olive oil
over bread. 

Add turkey stock until bread is moistened but not soggy and mix all the
ingredients.

Transfer mixture to a an oven proof casserole dish and cover with lid or foil. Bake at 350
for 45-60 minutes -- uncovering for 15-20 minutes if you want crusty top.
