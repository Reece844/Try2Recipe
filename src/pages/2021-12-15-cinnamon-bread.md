**To make the dough:**  Combine all of the dough ingredients.  Mix and knead everything together in stand mixer with dough hook (about 7 minutes on speed 2).  It should form a smooth ball.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl.  Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise, at room temperature, until it's nearly doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Rising may take longer, especially if you knead by hand.  Give the dough enough time to become quite puffy.

**To make the filling:**  While the dough is rising, make the filling by stirring together the sugar, cinnamon, and flour.

**To fill and shape the bread:**  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and pat it into a 6" x 20" rectangle.

Brush the dough with the egg/water mixture, and sprinkle it evenly with the filling.

Starting with the short end, roll the dough into a log.  Pinch the ends to seal, pinch the long seam closed.

Transfer the log, seam-side down to a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.  Tent the pan loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap.

Allow the bread to rise until it;s crested about 1" over the rim of the pan, about 1 hour.  Again, it may rise more slowly for you; let it rise till it's 1" over the rim of the pan, even if that takes longer than an hour.  While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 350 degreesF.

Bake the bread for 40-45 minutes, tenting it lightly with aluminum foil after the first 15 minutes.  The bread's crust will be golden brown, and interior of the finished loaf should be 190 degreesF on a digital thermometer.

Remove the bread from the oven, gently loosen the edges with a heat proof spatula or table knife.  Turn it out of the pan, and brush the top surface with butter, if desired; this will give it a soft, satiny crust.  Allow the bread to cool before slicing.
