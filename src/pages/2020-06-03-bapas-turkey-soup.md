First you make the broth from the bones along with some vegetables. Then you use the broth to make the soup.

Broth:
Place the turkey and water in a large pot (the water should cover the turkey by at least 2&quot;). Bring the water slowly to a boil over medium heat.

As the water comes to boil, skim any foam that rises to the surface with a fine sieve. Adjust the heat once a
boil is reached, so that a slow, lazy simmer is established. Cover partially and simmer for at least 2 hours.

Add the remaining ingredients. Continue to simmer for 1-2 hours.Strain the broth through a fine sieve discarding the solids.

Either skim the fat off the surface or process it though a fat separating funnel. The broth is now ready to use to
make the soup. At this point if you think it needs more flavor you can add canned turkey or chicken broth and
or salt.

Soup:
Add broth to large pot and bring to a simmer. Add the vegetables and simmer until the vegetables are tender (about 45-60 minutes). Adjust flavor with stock
or salt.

Notes: 
I start the broth as soon as I carve the turkey and let is simmer while we eat. Then finish it after the meal. I cut up all the vegetables at once and put them in gallon zip locks (the one for the broth I put all the ingredients in the bag). That way the veggies for the soup are ready without a second mess. You can add other things to the soup as you wish -- veggies, barley, rice. Of course don't forget noodles for those who like them. I add them to each bowl of soup so they don't get too soggy or "contaminate"; a gluten free soup.
