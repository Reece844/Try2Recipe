Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a baking dish. While a 9X9 inch baking
dish is recommended, other dimensions will also work.

Crack two eggs into a bowl and beat them. To the eggs, add the 1/2 cup of melted butter. Mix all ingredients. Put the cornbread mix in a separate large bowl and add the egg and butter mixture. To this, add the can of whole kernel corn, can of creamed corn, and sour cream (or the Greek yogurt). Mix well until it's blended together to give a creamy consistency.

Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and put in the oven for 45-60 minutes at
350 degrees. Check to see if the corn casserole has formed a golden crust on the outside
before removing it from the oven.
