Cut the first three ingredients together in a large bowl.

Pour the egg and vinegar into a measuring cup and add water so that the total amount in the measuring cup is 1 cup. Mix the cup of wet ingredients with the dry mixture gently, then form the dough into a disk and wrap with saran wrap. 

Rest in the fridge for at least an hour before using.
