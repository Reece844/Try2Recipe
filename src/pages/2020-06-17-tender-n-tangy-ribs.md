1. Combine first nine ingredients in a slow cooker. Cut ribs into serving size pieces but don't add to the slow cooker yet.

2. Add oil to a large skillet on medium to high heat. Once oil is hot, fill the skillet with ribs and cook until browned. Repeat until all of the ribs are browned and then transfer them all to the slow cooker.

3. Cover and cook on low for 4-6 hours.
