**Dressing:**

3 tbsp olive oil

1 tbsp grated lemon zest plus 6 tbsp. juice (2 lemons)

1 tbsp.dijonmustard

1 tbsp. minced shallot

1/2 tsp coriander

salt and pepper

(Salad was dry when eaten on day made - was best 2 days later or increase dressing volume)

**Salad:**

1 (12 oz; 10-12 cups) package mixed greens (recipe called for escarole, chicory frisee or other bitter green torn into bite sized pieces).I used 1 (10 oz) pkg. Trader Joe's Cruciferous crunch which includes shaved brussel sprouts, chopped kale and cabbage.Stayed crunchy!

1 (15 oz) can chick peas, rinsed and drained

3 carrots, peeled and shredded

3/4 cup craisins

1/2 cup slivered almonds

1/3 cup feta

(I used more of the feta and craisins and almonds than recipe called for to make up for the "less" greens in package.
