Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour 2 medium (8 1/2 inch) loaf pans.

In a medium bowl sift the flour, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until blended.  Beat in the banana, then beat in the eggs one at a time for 30 seconds each.  Add the banana and vanilla.  Stir in nuts if using.  Add combined dry ingredients until just blended.

Spread evenly in the 2 prepared pans.  Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 55-65 minutes.  Cool in pans for 10 minutes and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Makes 2 medium loaves.
