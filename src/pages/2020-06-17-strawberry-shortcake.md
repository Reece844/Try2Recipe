Heat oven to 375F. Grease and glour 8 or 9-inch round cake pan. In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, powder and salt. Using a food processor or fork cut in the margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk and eggs, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened. Spoon into greased and floured pan.

Bake at 375F for 25 to 30 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; invert onto serving platter. If you want you can cut the cake in half for a filled middle layer. 

In a medium bowl combine strawberries and sugar; mix well. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until you're ready to serve.

Just before serving prepare the topping. In a small bowl, beat whipping cream until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and vanilla; beat until stiff peaks form. Serve with shortcake and sweetened strawberries, store in the refrigerator.
