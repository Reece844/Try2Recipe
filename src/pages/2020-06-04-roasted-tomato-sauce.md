In the summer we grow an orange-colored cherry tomato called sungolds; The plants are very productive so we always have leftovers. We use this recipe to preserve the taste of these summer tomatoes for the rest of the year. Baking in the oven for such a long time makes the tomatoes even sweeter. You can freeze your sauce in containers and use it on
pizza or on pasta mixed with pieces of chicken breast or as a base for a vegetable stew (I
add fresh zucchini).

If you use regular tomatoes, peel them in the usual way (Cut a cross in the bottom of each
one with a sharp knife and put them in boiling water for 1 minute. Remove from the hot
water and put directly into cold water to slip off their skins). Trim over a bowl, catching
all the juice. For the cherry tomatoes, you can leave the skins on.

Cut the (regular) tomatoes into large chunks or wedges. Peel and chop the onions. Peel
and slice the garlic cloves.

Toss together all the ingredients, including the juice of the tomatoes, and spread it all
evenly over a large baking pan.

Roast the mixture in a preheated 375 degree oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stirring once after
the 1st hour, then every 3 minutes or so. Most of the liquid will cook away, and the
tomatoes will look like a caramelized marmalade.
