Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Grease and flour 2 medium (8 1/2 inch) loaf pans.

In a medium bowl sift flour, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.

In mixer bowl beat together the butter and sugar until well blended.  Add eggs 1 at a time beating on high speed for 30 seconds each.  Beat in the bananas until completely mixed.  Stir in nuts, if using.  Add the dry ingredients until just blended on low speed.

Spread evenly in the 2 prepared pans.  Bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean, 55-65 minutes.

Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
