In a bowl wash quinoa in a least 5 changes of cold water, rubbing the grains and letting them settle before pouring off most of the water, until the water runs clear, then drain into a large fine sieve.


In a pot of salted water, cook the quinoa for 10 minutes. Drain the quinoa in a fine sieve and rinse under cold water. Set the fine sieve over a pot of boiling water (quinoa should not touch the water) and steam the quinoa, covered with a kitchen towel and lid for 10 minutes.


While the quinoa is steaming, in a small bowl toss the beans with vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the quinoa to a large bowl and cool, add the beans, corn, bell pepper, jalapenos, and cilantro and toss well.


In a small bowl whisk together lime juice, salt and cumin and add oil in a stream, whisking. Drizzle dressing over salad and toss with salt and pepper to taste. Salad may be made 1 day ahead and chilled with a cover. Bring salad to room temperature before serving.
