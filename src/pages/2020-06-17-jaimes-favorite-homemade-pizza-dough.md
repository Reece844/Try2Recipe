Mix the yeast, salt, sugar and olive oil with the water in a 5 quart bowl, or a lidded (not
airtight) food container. (Can use plastic wrap.)

Mix in flour without kneading, using a spoon, a 14-cup capacity food processor (with
dough attachment) or a heavy duty stand mixer (with dough hook). If not using a
machine, you may have to use wet hands to incorporate last of the flour.

Cover (not airtight) and allow to rest at room temperature until dough rises and collapses
(or flattens on top), approximately 2 hours.

The dough can be used immediately after initial rise, though it is easier to handle when
cold. Refrigerate in a lidded (not airtight) container and use over the next 12 days.
